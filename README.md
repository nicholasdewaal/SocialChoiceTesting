# SocialChoiceTesting
This software samples the social utility for a variety of prominent social-choice functions along with some of my ideas for new and hopefully better social-choice functions.

This is a work in progress, and is NOT ready to use. Also, a better ReadMe will be provided at a later time.

Work left to do includes creating tests, finishing simulations, and documentation.
