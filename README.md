# SocialChoiceTesting
This software samples the social utility for a variety of prominent social-choice functions along with some of my ideas for new and hopefully better social-choice functions. The goal is to find a social-choice function that best addresses constraints of election manipulability according to Gibbard's Theorem, constraints from Arrow's Theorem, and design election systems to maintain the stability of governments with highly polarized politics. Optimizing social welfare relative to these constraints is the overall goal.

This software is a work in progress, and is NOT ready to use. Also, a better ReadMe will be provided at a later time.

Work left to do includes creating tests, finishing simulations, and documentation.
